AutoBot – Landing Page:
This is a responsive landing page built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Vercel v0 as part of the AutoBotWA frontend assignment.

Tech Stack:
Next.js
Tailwind CSS
Custom Components
Vercel v0

Features:
Hero Section with CTA
Features Section
Testimonials
Pricing Section
Footer
Fully Responsive

I used Vercel v0 to generate the Hero, Features, Testimonials, Pricing, and Footer sections.
After generating them, I customized the styling, responsiveness, and layout using Tailwind CSS.
I also created a custom Button component to keep the project lightweight.
The project uses a clean component-based structure and is deployed on Vercel.
